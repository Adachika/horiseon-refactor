# Project Title
Horiseon webpage refactor

## Description 
This goal of this project was to refactor the code of a given webpage to meet accessibility standards. As a requirement, the webpage should include semantic HTML elements and these elements should follow a logical structure regardless of styling and positioning. The page should also include a descriptive title and every image element should have an alt attribute that displays in the event that the image fails to load correctly. In addition, the webpage should include heading elements that follow a sequential order.

Accessibility standards are a set of guidelines that should be followed when designing a website so as to enhance user experience. A good website should adhere to four basic standards- Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. 

Information must be provided to users in a way such that it is not invisible to all their senses (Perceivability). User interface on the website should be such that users can navigate them (Operability). The information presented on the page should be easy to comprehend (understable), and finally, content should be robust enough so that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of users. 

### Changes made 
- added a more descriptive title
- included semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer)
- placed heading tags in sequential order
- add alt attributes to images
- modified nav links to change color when the cursor is placed on them
- modified the code such that clicking a link takes a user to the section of the main where description is given.
